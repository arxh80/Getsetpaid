-- ===========================================================================
-- PHASE 8 TASK 6 -- THE FOUR CENSUSES AND INVARIANTS THIS TASK'S OWN TWO
-- TABLES TRIPPED, ANSWERED RATHER THAN EXCUSED BY EDITING THE CHECK.
--
-- All four are the house invariants doing their job on a new table, and each
-- one is answered in the direction the invariant asks for:
--
--   D3  (schema_invariants) EVERY FOREIGN KEY'S LEADING COLUMN IS INDEXED.
--       public.retention_settings.updated_by had no index. CLAUDE.md
--       section Non-negotiable rules: "Index every foreign key." One row in
--       the table makes the index worthless for planning and that is not the
--       point -- the invariant exists so that the question is never asked per
--       table, and a table that is an exception "because it is small" is how
--       the next one gets missed.
--
--   L5  (rls_phase2_crm) EVERY TABLE CARRYING `updated_at` HAS THE TRIGGER.
--       public.retention_settings does. public.set_retention_enabled() sets
--       updated_at itself, so the trigger changes no behaviour today -- but
--       "the RPC remembers to" is exactly the guarantee the trigger exists to
--       replace, and a second writer added later would not remember.
--
--   R1/R1a/R2 (schema_invariants) NO PRIVATE FUNCTION A `CHECK` CALLS IS
--       UNREACHABLE BY `authenticated`. private.jsonb_is_retention_summary()
--       was revoked from everything, the house rule for a `private` helper --
--       and Task 5 section 5(a) is the cautionary tale of applying that rule
--       to the one kind of function it must not be applied to: a CHECK is
--       evaluated with the privileges of the role performing the WRITE, so
--       revoking it made public.erasure_jobs unwritable by every client role
--       and nobody could ask for their account to be deleted at all.
--
--       NO CLIENT ROLE CAN WRITE public.retention_runs TODAY, so the grant
--       buys nothing now. It is issued anyway, in the direction the invariant
--       asks for, because the alternative is to add a fourth exception to a
--       roll whose whole value is that it has none -- and because the day
--       somebody adds a client write path, the failure is a permission denied
--       on a function nobody would think to look at. The function is a pure
--       predicate over a jsonb value: it reads no table, discloses nothing,
--       and answers a question the caller already knows the answer to.
--
--   XC3 (rls_phase8_exports) EVERY TABLE WITH A ROW -> USER PATH IS IN THE
--       ACCOUNT CATALOGUE. public.retention_settings.updated_by is such a
--       path. It is excused, with the reason on the row.
--
-- ADDITIVE. private.export_catalogue() is rebuilt from its LATEST definition,
-- read out of pg_get_functiondef.
-- ===========================================================================

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. D3: the foreign key's leading column, indexed.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
create index retention_settings_updated_by_idx
  on public.retention_settings (updated_by);

comment on index public.retention_settings_updated_by_idx is
  'The FK-covering index every foreign key in this schema carries (schema_invariants section D3). The table holds ONE row, so this buys the planner nothing -- it is here because the invariant is per-schema and not per-table, and a table exempted "because it is small" is how the next one gets missed.';


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. L5: the updated_at trigger.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
drop trigger if exists set_updated_at on public.retention_settings;
create trigger set_updated_at before update on public.retention_settings
  for each row when (old.* is distinct from new.*)
  execute function private.set_updated_at();


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. R1/R2: the CHECK's function, reachable from the role that would perform
--    a write -- Task 5 section 5(a)'s lesson, applied before it costs
--    anything rather than after.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
grant execute on function private.jsonb_is_retention_summary(jsonb) to authenticated;

comment on function private.jsonb_is_retention_summary(jsonb) is
  'The shape public.retention_runs.swept is allowed to have: a flat object whose every value is a NUMBER or a BOOLEAN. Numbers are the counts; the booleans are each sweep''s `capped` flag. Deliberately NOT private.jsonb_is_count_map(), which admits a boolean only under three erasure-specific keys and refused the first retention row anybody tried to write -- widening THAT predicate would have loosened public.erasure_jobs.summary as a side effect. What both share is the part that matters: no string can reach either column, so a filename, a search term or a PostgreSQL error message cannot arrive in a summary rendered on a cross-tenant operator page. EXECUTE is granted to `authenticated` (20261003010000) although no client role can write the table: a CHECK constraint is evaluated with the privileges of the role performing the WRITE, and Task 5 section 5(a) is what revoking it from that role costs -- public.erasure_jobs became unwritable by everybody and nobody could ask for their account to be deleted at all.';
