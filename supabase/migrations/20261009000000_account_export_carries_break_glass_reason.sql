-- ===========================================================================
-- PHASE 8 TASK 9a, JOB 2 -- THE ACCOUNT EXPORT CARRIES THE BREAK-GLASS
-- REASON AND THE OPERATOR'S IDENTITY (founder 2026-09-30, Q167 CHANGED).
--
-- 20260928001000 projected the account export's impersonation_sessions read
-- to the eleven columns describing the requester's OWN decision, withholding
-- the operator's free-text `reason` and `superuser_user_id`, and recorded the
-- counter-argument against Q167: a person may be entitled to know WHY their
-- workspace was accessed. The founder took the counter-argument on
-- 2026-09-30. This migration adopts it -- and only it.
--
-- WHICH SESSIONS. Unchanged, and deliberately so. "A session that touched
-- the data subject" is what the catalogue already scopes this row to: the
-- sessions the requester DECIDED -- `admin_accepted_by` or `declined_by` is
-- them. That is the one thing on the row that is the requester's personal
-- data (their own act of consent or refusal). A session in a workspace they
-- belong to but which a colleague decided is not theirs, a session in
-- another tenant is not theirs, and neither is returned -- before or after
-- this change. (A current admin reads every session of their workspace
-- through RLS already; this export is for the person who has left.)
--
-- WHICH IDENTITY. `superuser_user_id`, the account id recorded on the
-- session, and nothing joined to it. It is the narrowest identifier the row
-- itself holds; the alternatives (the operator's email or display name)
-- would mean joining auth.users / profiles into an elevated read, which the
-- read engine cannot do and which would export more than the session
-- records. The manifest carries a note saying what the id denotes (the
-- GetSetPaid platform operator), so the subject can use it. If the founder
-- wants a name or address resolved instead, that is Q194.
--
-- WHAT CHANGES. Exactly two columns are added to one projection, and one
-- excused row's reason stops citing the overturned argument. The function is
-- rebuilt from its LATEST definition (pg_get_functiondef as left by
-- 20260930007000), never from the migration that created it. The soundness
-- check (20260928001000 / 20260929000000) is untouched: every elevated row
-- still carries a projection, and this one still does.
--
-- ADDITIVE. No previously applied migration is edited.
